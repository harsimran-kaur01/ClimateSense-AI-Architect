# 🌱 ClimateSense AI Architect

**AI-powered passive climate design assistant built with Gemini 3**

ClimateSense AI Architect is a next-generation design intelligence tool that analyzes architectural floor plans alongside climate context to generate interpretable, visual passive design insights. It helps architects, students, and planners understand airflow, heat risk, daylight quality, and overall passive performance early in the design process.

This is a **new application** built specifically for the **Gemini 3 Global Hackathon**.

## 🚀 What It Does

ClimateSense transforms static design inputs into dynamic climate intelligence:

- 🧭 Visual floor plan analysis with room-level diagnostics  
- 🌬 Airflow reasoning across connected spaces  
- 🔥 Heat risk overlays based on orientation and zoning  
- ☀️ Daylight quality mapping per room  
- 📊 Climate performance index summarizing passive efficiency  

All insights are AI-generated, not rule-based, and update interactively.

## 🧠 Gemini 3 Integration (Core Innovation)

Gemini 3 is the reasoning engine behind ClimateSense.

The application uses Gemini 3 to:
- Interpret structured spatial data (room geometry, adjacencies, labels)
- Reason over climate context (climate zone, temperature ranges, solar exposure)
- Generate room-level diagnostics for airflow paths, heat risk, and daylight quality
- Produce quantified passive performance metrics used directly in visualizations

Unlike traditional simulation tools, ClimateSense relies on Gemini 3’s advanced reasoning capabilities to infer relationships between spatial layout and climate behavior without requiring full physical simulation models.

The UI does not merely display AI text — it renders Gemini’s reasoning outputs directly into spatial overlays, charts, and performance indicators, enabling real-time design feedback.  
**Without Gemini 3, this application would not function.**

## ⚠️ Indicative Performance Disclaimer

**Disclaimer:**  
All performance metrics, airflow paths, daylight scores, and thermal insights generated by ClimateSense AI Architect are indicative and exploratory.

They are intended to support early-stage design reasoning and decision-making only and should not be used as a substitute for detailed engineering simulations, code compliance checks, or professional environmental analysis.
